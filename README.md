`**Abstract**
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Business Intelligence project conducted for Toast, Inc., an IT software company specializing in cloud-based restaurant management software. The project aimed to address operational challenges through strategic data analysis and visualization. Key components include the identification of challenges, the methodology employed, setup instructions, and insightful data visualizations leading to strategic recommendations for Toast's future operations.
Introduction
Toast, Inc., headquartered in Boston, MA, specializes in cloud-based restaurant management software, with Android OS as the primary POS system. Despite being the third-fastest-growing technology company in 2019, Toast faced challenges with their dated POS system, hindering data visualization capabilities. This document introduces a Business Intelligence project conducted to overcome these challenges and enhance operational efficiency.
**Problem Statement**
Toast's rapid growth lacked comprehensive insights into key factors like customer orders, menu performance, and employee efficiency. Benchmarking against industry competitors and adapting to market changes became difficult. The reliance on inherited tools exposed vulnerabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Operational efficiency, pricing strategies, and customer base expansion were hampered without data-driven insights. The main challenge was in making informed strategic decisions for the company's future.
**Methodology**
The project employed a methodology involving the implementation of Business Intelligence tools, specifically Incorta, for data visualization and analysis. The challenges faced, including data sharding, lack of real-time insights, and operational inefficiencies, were systematically addressed through the integration of BI tools, providing a centralized and resilient system.

**Getting Started**
    1.	**Prerequisites**: 
    - Make sure you have Tableau Desktop installed on your machine. You can download a free trial or obtain a licensed version from the Tableau website (https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop).
    - Ensure you have a compatible operating system (Windows or macOS) that meets Tableau's system requirements.
    2.	**Dataset**: 
    The dataset, "RestaurantsDetails.xlsx," sourced from the GitHub repository "Restaurant-Sales-Analysis," provides essential information about restaurant details and sales. Accessible through this link, the dataset is anticipated to be a valuable resource for analyzing and understanding trends within the restaurant industry. It is recommended to thoroughly examine the dataset's structure and content to extract meaningful insights for subsequent analysis.
    3.	**Project Setup**:
     Begin by establishing a designated project directory on your local machine specifically for the Toast analysis project. This directory will serve as the centralized location for storing all project-related files and resources. Open Tableau Desktop on your computer. Ensure that you have Tableau Desktop installed, and if not, download and install it from the official Tableau website. Within the project directory, create a new Tableau workbook (.twbx) to initiate the visualization and analysis process for the Toast project. This workbook will be the canvas for importing, exploring, and visualizing the dataset related to restaurant sales and operations.
    4.	**Importing the Dataset**: - In Tableau Desktop, go to the "Data" menu and select "Connect‚Äù.

**Data Analysis and Visualization**
The analysis focused on key aspects such as the total number of restaurants, cuisines, peak order analysis, and customer ratings. Visualizations included bar charts, tree maps, and tables to provide insights into restaurant preferences, delivery performance, and customer ratings based on cuisine.

**Recommendation**
The document proposes alternative solutions, pros, and cons, and suggests implementing a robust Business Intelligence system to enhance data analysis and visualization. The importance of considering factors like vendor reputation, scalability, and security is emphasized.

**Conclusion**
The Business Intelligence project concludes with recommendations for Toast to leverage data-driven insights for long-term growth, profitability, and adaptability in the dynamic restaurant tech sector. The implementation of BI tools transforms data analysis, providing a foundation for strategic decision-making and operational improvements.
